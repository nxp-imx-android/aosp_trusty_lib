//! # The Trusty Rust Standard Library
//!
//! Rust for Trusty requires `no_std`, as the Rust standard library has not been
//! (and will likely never be) ported to Trusty. This crate provides a subset of
//! the standard library types and other generally useful APIs for building
//! trusted apps.
//!
//! This library is designed to accommodate fallible memory allocation and
//! provides types which may only be allocated fallibly. When the necessary APIs
//! are available [upstream](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/86942) or
//! in this crate, we plan to enable `no_global_oom_handling`, so do not write
//! code using this crate that relies on infallible allocation.
