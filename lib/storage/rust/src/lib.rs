//! Access to the Trusty storage service.
//!
//! The secure storage service provides encrypted and tamper proof storage to
//! secure apps. All operations that modify the file system state are
//! transactional. Files can be opened, create or deleted by name (where the
//! name is local to the app). Open files support read, write, get-size and
//! set-size operations. There is currently no support for sparse files,
//! permissions, quotas or directory operations.
//!
//! Here's a quick example of how to start a session with the storage service
//! and perform basic filesystem operations:
//!
//!```
//! use storage::{Session, Port, OpenMode};
//!
//! let session = Session::new(Port::TamperDetect)?;
//!
//! // Write file contents to disk, creating a new
//! // file or overwriting an existing one.
//! session.write(
//!     "foo.txt",
//!     "Hello, world!".as_bytes()
//! )?;
//!
//! // Read contents of a file.
//! let contents = session.read("foo.txt")?;
//! println!("Contents of `bar.txt`: {}", contents);
//!
//! // Open a file handle in order to perform more
//! // advanced operations like setting the size.
//! let file = session.open_file(
//!     "foo.txt",
//!     OpenMode::Open,
//! )?;
//!
//! session.set_size(&file, 1024)?;
//! ```
//!
//! # Getting Started
//!
//! To interact with the storage service you first need to start a session. The
//! storage service listens for connections on multiple different ports, and
//! provides different filesystem properties based on which port you connect to.
//! See [`Port`] for the available ports and their properties, though
//! [`TamperDetect`][Port::TamperDetect] should be your default if you do not
//! specifically need the properties provided by other ports.
//!
//! ```
//! use storage::{Session, Port};
//!
//! let session = Session::new(Port::TamperDetect)?;
//! ```
//!
//! All filesystem operations are performed through the [`Session`] object, see
//! the methods on [`Session`] for a list of operations. All filesystem
//! operations return a `Result`. If no specific error conditions are documented
//! for an operation, general errors may still still occur e.g. if there is an
//! issue communicating with the service.
//!
//! # Using Transactions
//!
//! It's possible to group multiple file operations into a transaction in order
//! to commit or discard all changes as a group. To do so, use
//! [`Session::begin_transaction`] to get a [`Transaction`] object.
//! [`Transaction`] exposes the same file manipulation methods as [`Session`],
//! but any changes done through [`Transaction`] will not be applied
//! immediately. Instead, [`Transaction::commit`] and [`Transaction::discard`]
//! are used to either commit the pending changes to disk or discard the pending
//! changes, respectively.
//!
//! If a [`Transaction`] object is dropped without being explicitly committed or
//! discarded, it will panic with a message reminding you to manually finalize
//! the transaction.
//!
//! ```
//! let transaction = session.begin_transaction();
//!
//! let file = transaction.open_file("foo.txt", OpenMode::Create)?;
//! transaction.write_all(&file, "Hello, world!".as_bytes())?;
//!
//! transaction.commit()?;
//! ```
//!
//! The main reason to use transactions instead of the simpler API provided by
//! [`Session`] is that it allows multiple file operations to be committed
//! atomically in a single transaction. This can be important for apps that need
//! to ensure that files in secure storage do not end up in an invalid state. In
//! the future it may also allow for more efficient disk operations by allowing
//! the storage service to write changes in bulk, but that is not currently
//! implemented.
//!
//! For simple use cases that only need to read or write an entire file the
//! simpler [`Session`] file access APIs can be good enough, but for more
//! complex use cases use the transaction API instead.
//!
//! The storage API is also designed such that while a transaction is open all
//! file operations must go through that transaction until it is either
//! committed or discarded. This ensures that there's no way to accidentally
//! perform a file operation through `Session` that circumvents the atomicity
//! guarantees provided by the transaction.
//!
//! # Listing Files
//!
//! You can use [`Session::list_files`] and [`Transaction::list_files`] to list
//! the files in the current session's storage. Note that the storage service
//! does not currently support directories, and so it always lists the files at
//! the root directory. The iterator returned by these methods yields the name
//! of the file and its current state, i.e. if the file is fully committed to
//! disk or if it is being added/removed in the current transaction.
//!
//! ```
//! for entry in session.list_files().unwrap() {
//!     let (name, state) = entry.unwrap();
//!     println!("File {} is in state {:?}", name, state);
//! }
//! ```
